EtfOsThreading
==============

The purpose of this project is to help students of School of Electrical Engineering, at the University of Belgrade learn operating systems.

Operating systems are a pretty difficult subject, and we almost always welcome any help.

In the classes, the teachers provide an interface for the problems, and the students are asked to write code on paper. This project provides an opportunity to compile and test that code, using the interface that is provided by the teachers.

The project is written in C++, and compiled and tested in Visual Studio 2015

I will try to add more stuff to this project as often as possible

Report all errors on my [school e-mail](mailto:bn140314d@student.etf.rs), or my [personal e-mail](mailto:bebicnikola@gmail.com)

Send me a message if you want me to implement anything else that we learn in operating systems classes.
